# bz
bz is a training automation tool for MLOps pipelines.

## Usage
Install using pip:

`pip install bz-cli`

Create a file called `train.py`. In that file, define your `model`, `loss_fn`, `optimizer`, and `training_loader`. Then just run `bz` to get started training.

Take a look at the the `train.py` file in this repo's `examples` folder. Run `bz` from that folder to try it out
